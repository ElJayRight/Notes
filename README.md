# README
This is a collection of everything I have done relating to Cyber Security and Programming. Currently I'm doing the OSCP!! So going to be doing a bunch of OSCP like boxes and content.



# What's on this site?

## Blogs / research I have done.
* [Bad USB (with a bit of AV evasion)](06%20-%20Random%20Shit/A%20quest%20to%20make%20a%20good%20bad%20usb.md)
* [RBCD the hard-ish way](06%20-%20Random%20Shit/RBCD%20-%20Without%20PowerView.md)
* [Wifi Research](06%20-%20Random%20Shit/Learning%20Wifi%20Attacks.md)
* [Wifi Hacking Part 1](06%20-%20Random%20Shit/Adventures%20with%20a%20RPI%20Part%201.md)

## A mock pentest report 
I did this for a HTB machine (Still a work in progress.)
* [Report](02%20-%20Hack%20The%20Box/Cascade/Cascade%20Report.md)

# Offensive Security Tooling
A collection of tools that I'm developing mainly focusing on AV evasion and Bad USB. Currently I'm working on a custom encoder that seems to be bypassing AV. (As of June 2023.)
* [Index of tools](Offsec%20Dev/What's%20This?.md)

## HTB machines
* [Index of boxes](02%20-%20Hack%20The%20Box/Readme.md)

## AD Network write ups
* [Throwback Network](03%20-%20Try%20Hack%20Me/Throwback/Notes.md)
* [Holo AD lab](03%20-%20Try%20Hack%20Me/AD%20LABS%20With%20Pentest%20Reports/Holo/Holo%20Notes%20Live.md) (work in progress)
* [Wreath AD lab](03%20-%20Try%20Hack%20Me/AD%20LABS%20With%20Pentest%20Reports/Wreath/Notes.md) (work in progress)

(need to also index ROP Emporium, pico gym, AoC2022)



# Things I want to learn / improve

## Learn a second programming language
I know python really well, but I would also like to learn either Java or Go.

## More AD hacking
I LOVE doing AD hacking and have done nearly finished all the ad labs I can find online that are next to free. I still have to do GOAD and keep up to date with new exploits.

## Web Apps
I'm pretty good at pentesting a web app but there are a few small things that I haven't got around to learning, for example advance XXE, clickjacking and CSRF attacks.



# Current Projects
I have a really bad habit of not finishing things. Below are the ones I'm currently juggling.

## Wifi research
Planning to do a part 2 and 3. Part 2 will go into running an evil twin attack on a RPi with the option of having a deauth attack. Part 3 will be taking this even further, mostly polishing off any issues I have run into and trying to create a deauther script for a Pico W.

## HTB Insane Windows
Want to complete all the insane windows boxes following a guide, as this is the best way I can learn how to chain together exploits and automate attacks.

## Bad USB
Continue the bad usb research. I think I have everything figured out and I just need to sit down and do it.
