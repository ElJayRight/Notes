This is all legacy stuff so instead go here: [https://blog.eljayright.dev](https://blog.eljayright.dev) its like this but better :)
All the good stuff will be ported over.

I did this for a HTB machine (Still a work in progress.)
* [Report](02%20-%20Hack%20The%20Box/Cascade/Cascade%20Report.md)

## Offensive Security Tooling
A collection of tools that I'm developing mainly focusing on AV evasion and Bad USB. Currently I'm working on a custom encoder that seems to be bypassing AV. (As of June 2023.)
* [Index of tools](Offsec%20Dev/README.md)

(need to also index ROP Emporium, pico gym, AoC2022)



# Current Projects
I have a really bad habit of not finishing things. Below are the ones I'm currently juggling.

## Wifi research
Planning to do a part 2 and 3. Part 2 will go into running an evil twin attack on a RPi with the option of having a deauth attack. Part 3 will be taking this even further, mostly polishing off any issues I have run into and trying to create a deauther script for a Pico W.

## HTB Insane Windows
Want to complete all the insane windows boxes following a guide, as this is the best way I can learn how to chain together exploits and automate attacks.

## Bad USB
Continue the bad usb research. I think I have everything figured out and I just need to sit down and do it.
