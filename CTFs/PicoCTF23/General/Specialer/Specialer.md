So bash will let you list things in a dir by pressing tab twice after a command.

So instead of using ls we can use `cat <tab><tab>`

Three directories

reading all files like so:
```
echo "$(< filename)"
```

```
echo "$(< ala/kazam.txt)" 
```

Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_38f5cc78}
```
