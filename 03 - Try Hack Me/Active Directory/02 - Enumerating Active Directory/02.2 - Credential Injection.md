# [02.2 - Credential Injection]
## Notes
---
creds from the distributor
charles.anderson:Wafx2845

Runas.exe is a useful builtin windows exe
This tool finds where creds are valid and also loads them into memory
/netonly will load for network auth but not against the DC (think you need kerberos for this?)

DNS allows kerberos auth first, as Kerberos uses hostname embedded tickets. IP forces NTLM. This will avoid some detection but then not allow pass-the-hash
