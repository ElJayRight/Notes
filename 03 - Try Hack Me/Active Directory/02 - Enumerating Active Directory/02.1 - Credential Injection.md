# [02.1 - Credential Injection]
## Notes
---
Runas
If AD Creds are found but you dont know where to login runas can inject them into memory and then tyr to login across the network.
```powershell
runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
```
/netonly - Any network connections will use this account but all other local commands will run with the standard windows user.
/user - the username for the domain. Shoudl use the FUlly Qualified Domain Name instead of NetBIOS. This will help with DNS resolution.
cmd.exe - The program to be used once the creds are injected.
