## Task Description
Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? It looks like Dr. Oswal added a stack canary to this [program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/492/vuln) to protect against buffer overflows. You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/492/vuln.c). And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 57553`

## Notes
buffer size of 64
canary size of 4
you can brute force the canary then write out the ret addr.

leak canary then check for EIP.
16 more bytes
get ret addr
0x08049336
