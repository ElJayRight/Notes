## Task Description
Overflow x64 code Most problems before this are 32-bit x86. Now we'll consider 64-bit x86 which is a little different! Overflow the buffer and change the return address to the `flag` function in this [program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/194/vuln). [Download source](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/194/vuln.c). `nc saturn.picoctf.net 52581`
## Notes
ret addr: 0x401236
buffer size: 72
payload (have to pass in 3 bytes for ret addr)
this doesn't work, looking at the code you need to jump a few instructions down and then it gives out the flag.
